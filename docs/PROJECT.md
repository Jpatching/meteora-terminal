# meteora-terminal

## 1. Overview
`meteora-terminal` is a Node.js + TypeScript CLI for interacting with **Meteora DLMM liquidity pools** on Solana.  
It allows liquidity providers and token project operators to discover pools, open positions, claim fees, and send broadcast alerts â€” all from the terminal.

The project is structured as a reusable toolkit and a production-ready CLI.

## 2. Core User Flows (v1)

### ðŸ§© A. Discover & Watch Pools
- Discover all active DLMM pools with details like **TVL**, **APR**, **fee tier**, and **active bin**.  
- Filter and sort by metrics (APR / TVL).  
- Use `discover` for one-shot queries, or `watch` for live refreshing.

### ðŸ’§ B. LP Lifecycle
- Resolve pool symbols (e.g., `SOL-USDC`) into on-chain addresses.  
- Open new LP positions in custom price ranges via the DLMM SDK.  
- Claim fees from existing positions using wallet credentials.

### ðŸ“¢ C. Alerts / Broadcasting
- Send Telegram alerts directly from the CLI using bot credentials.
- Useful for liquidity announcements, operator alerts, or monitoring triggers.
